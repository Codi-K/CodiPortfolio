            have on your team and there is a sense of pride in everything he does. His understanding of web development
            makes him an advantage and I see him doing great things going forward.</p>

            individual who ensures that his objectives are always met no matter how hard the task. He is someone that
            always ensures to make you feel part of the team. However, if needed he works really well alone as well. He
            is definitely a great addition to any team or company.</p>

            and guides his peers to the right solution when they need help with their code. Codi is kind and enjoys to
            code. He would be an asset to any field and career he works in.</p>
